        <h2 style="color: white;">Programmer</h2>
        <p style="color: white; text-indent: 2em;">My first programming language was Java. I've worked with the language on numerous projects in college spanning five years. I recently started to pick up Ruby and prefer it over Java. Why? Imagine you are dancing with a partner that is stiff and requires more energy to direct. That's java. When it comes to Ruby it feels more natural and easy going. I am just happy I don't have to make a public get method every time I have to get to a private class variable. I just need to type is attr_reader and the variable. </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-style: oblique">Why do I program?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-indent: 2em;">I program for many reasons. First, the world is becoming more digital and I wanted to be a part of the group of people that pushes society to new horizon utilizing man's most powerful tool to do so. Secondly, the addictive feeling of accomplishment when I fixed a problem after hours of trial and error. Thirdly, to be creative. To build new or improve applications in which I can easily share to others.</p>

      <p style="color: white; text-indent: 2em;">I enjoy seeing change. As a gardener, growth is the main driver. Just likes plants that have their fundamental requirements to grow (Nitrogen,Phosphorus, and Potassium), I take inspiration to grow as a programmer by nourishing my skills with the four pillars of object-oriented programming. </p>
      <p style="color: white;">Abstraction, to hide away implied details inside something. Users don't need to know every single step to achieve a result.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">Encapsulation, to remove access making things private. A program only needs to know what it requires to know to function, not everything.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">Inheritance, to allow an object to acquire properties and methods of another object.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">Polymorphism, to enable objects to take on multiple forms.</p>
      <p style="color: white; text-indent: 2em;">Understanding these concepts are my building blocks to grow more robust and maintainable code.</p>
